<summary>Maya: Apply initial viewport shader for Redshift Proxy after loading <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/6102">#6102</a></summary>

When the published redshift proxy is being loaded, the shader of the proxy is missing. This is different from the manual load through creating redshift proxy for files. This PR is to assign the default lambert to the redshift proxy, which replicates the same approach when the user manually loads the proxy with filepath.

<summary>Houdini: Add support to split Deadline render tasks in export + render <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5420">#5420</a></summary>

This adds initial support in Houdini so when submitting render jobs to Deadline it's not running as a single Houdini task but rather it gets split in two different tasks: Export + Render. This way it's more efficient as we only need a Houdini license during the export step and the render tasks can run exclusively with a render license. Moreover, we aren't wasting all the overhead time of opening the render scene in Houdini for every frame.I have also added the corresponding settings json files so we can set some of the default values for the Houdini deadline submitter.

The creation of Ftrack components needs to allow for multiple thumbnails.

Customers have asked for unique thumbnails for each data stream.For instance, one stream might contain a baked LUT file along with Display and View. Another stream might only include the baked Display and View. These variations can change the overall look. Thus, we found it necessary to depict these differences via thumbnails.

<summary>Use host's node uniqueness for instance id in new publisher <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5490">#5490</a></summary>

Instead of writing `instance_id` as parm or attributes on the publish instances we can, for some hosts, just rely on a unique name or path within the scene to refer to that particular instance. By doing so we fix #4820 because upon duplicating such a publish instance using the host's (DCC) functionality the uniqueness for the duplicate is then already ensured instead of attributes remaining exact same value as where to were duplicated from, making `instance_id` a non-unique value.

<summary>General: Avoid fallback if value is 0 for handle start/end <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5652">#5652</a></summary>

There's a bug on the `pyblish_functions.get_time_data_from_instance_or_context` where if `handleStart` or `handleEnd` on the instance are set to value 0 it's falling back to grabbing the handles from the instance context. Instead, the logic should be that it only falls back to the `instance.context` if the key doesn't exist.This change was only affecting me on the `handleStart`/`handleEnd` and it's unlikely it could cause issues on `frameStart`, `frameEnd` or `fps` but regardless, the `get` logic is wrong.

<summary>Deadline: handle all valid paths in RenderExecutable <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5694">#5694</a></summary>

This commit enhances the path resolution mechanism in the RenderExecutable function of the Ayon plugin. Previously, the function only considered paths starting with a tilde (~), ignoring other valid paths listed in exe_list. This limitation led to an empty expanded_paths list when none of the paths in exe_list started with a tilde, causing the function to fail in finding the Ayon executable.With this fix, the RenderExecutable function now correctly processes and includes all valid paths from exe_list, improving its reliability and preventing unnecessary errors related to Ayon executable location.

This handles the situation when `ExtractReviewIntermediates` (previously `ExtractReviewDataMov`) has multiple outputs, including thumbnails that need to be integrated. Previously, integrating the thumbnail representation was causing an issue in the integration process. However, we have now resolved this issue by no longer integrating thumbnails as loadable representations.NOW default is that thumbnail representation are NOT integrated (eg. they will not show up in DB > couldn't be Loaded in Loader) and no `_thumb.jpg` will be left in `render` (most likely) publish folder.IF there would be need to override this behavior, please use `project_settings/global/publish/PreIntegrateThumbnails`

<summary>Deadline: set PATH environment in deadline jobs by GlobalJobPreLoad <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5622">#5622</a></summary>

This PR makes `GlobalJobPreLoad` to set `PATH` environment in deadline jobs so that we don't have to use the full executable path for deadline to launch the dcc app. This trick should save us adding logic to pass houdini patch version and modifying Houdini deadline plugin. This trick should work with other DCCs

<summary>Maya: Reduce amount of code for Collect Looks <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5253">#5253</a></summary>

- Refactor `get_file_node_files` because popping from `paths` by index should have been done in reversed order anyway. It's now changed to not need popping at all.
- Removed unused `RENDERER_NODE_TYPES` and if-branch which collected `node_attrs` list which was unused + collected members which was also done outside of the if branch and thus generated no extra data.
- Collected all materials from look set attributes at once instead of multiple queries
- Collected all file nodes in history from a single query instead of per type
- Restructured assignment of `instance.data["resources"]` to be more readable
- Cached `PXR_NODES` only ones (Note: plugin load is checked on discovery of the collect look plugin) instead of querying plugin load and its nodes per file node per attribute
- Removed some debug logs or combined some messages

<summary>Maya: Extract look is not AYON compatible - OP-5375 <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5341">#5341</a></summary>

The textures that would use hardlinking are going through texture processors. Currently all texture processors are hardcoded to copy texture instead of respecting the settings of forcing to copy.The texture processors were last modified 4 months ago, so effectively all clients that are on any pipeline updated in the last 4 months wont be utilizing hardlinking at all, since the hardcoded texture processors will copy texture no matter the OS.This opts for completely disabling the hardlinking feature, while we figure out what to do about it.

<summary>Maya: Fix look assigner showing no asset if 'not found' representations are present <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5597">#5597</a></summary>

Fix Maya Look assigner failing to show any content if it finds an invalid container for which it can't find the asset in the current project. (This can happen when e.g. loading something from a library project).There was logic already to avoid this but there was a bug where it used variable `_id` which did not exist and likely had to be `asset_id`.I've fixed that and improved the logged message a bit, e.g.:
```
// Warning: openpype.hosts.maya.tools.mayalookassigner.commands : Id found on 22 nodes for which no asset is found database, skipping '641d78ec85c3c5b102e836b0'
```
Example not found representation in Loader:The issue isn't necessarily related to NOT FOUND representations but in essence boils down to finding nodes with asset ids that do not exist in the current project which could very well just be local meshes in your scene.**Note:**I've excluded logging the nodes themselves because that tends to be a very long list of nodes. Only downside to removing that is that it's unclear which nodes are related to that `id`. If there are any ideas on how to still provide a concise informational message about that that'd be great so I could add it. Things I had considered:
- Report the containers, issue here is that it's about asset ids on nodes which don't HAVE to be in containers - it could be local geometry
- Report the namespaces, issue here is that it could be nodes without namespaces (plus potentially not about ALL nodes in a namespace)
- Report the short names of the nodes; it's shorter and readable but still likely a lot of nodes.@tokejepsen @LiborBatek any other ideas?

<summary>Nuke: publish existing frames on farm <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5409">#5409</a></summary>

This PR proposes adding a fourth option in Nuke render publish called "Use Existing Frames - Farm". This would be useful when the farm is busy or when the artist lacks enough farm licenses. Additionally, some artists prefer rendering on the farm but still want to check frames before publishing.By adding the "Use Existing Frames - Farm" option, artists will have more flexibility and control over their render publishing process. This enhancement will streamline the workflow and improve efficiency for Nuke users.

- OP's absolute version, matching the `version` index in DB.
- Relative version in reverse order from the last one: `-2`, `-3`...I don't know where I should write documentation about that.

This PR exposes control over the order of processing of the instances, by sorting the instances created. The sorting happens on the `render_order` and subset name. If the knob `render_order` is found on the instance, we'll sort by that first before sorting by subset name.`render_order` instances are processed before nodes without `render_order`. This could be extended in the future by querying other knobs but I dont know of a usecase for this.Hardcoded the creator `order` attribute of the `prerender` class to be before the `render`. Could be exposed to the user/studio but dont know of a use case for this.

<summary>Documentation: API docs reborn - yet again <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4419">#4419</a></summary>

## Feature

Add functional base for API Documentation using Sphinx and AutoAPI.

After unsuccessful #2512, #834 and #210 this is yet another try. But this time without ambition to solve the whole issue. This is making Shinx script to work and nothing else. Any changes and improvements in API docs should be made in subsequent PRs.

## How to use it

You can run:

```sh
cd .\docs
make.bat html
```

or

```sh
cd ./docs
make html
```

This will go over our code and generate **.rst** files in `/docs/source/autoapi` and from those it will generate full html documentation in `/docs/build/html`.

During the build you'll see tons of red errors that are pointing to our issues:

1) **Wrong imports**
    Invalid import are usually wrong relative imports (too deep) or circular imports.

2) **Invalid doc-strings**
   Doc-strings to be processed into documentation needs to follow some syntax - this can be checked by running
   `pydocstyle` that is already included with OpenPype
3) **Invalid markdown/rst files**
    md/rst files can be included inside rst files using `.. include::` directive. But they have to be properly formatted.


## Editing rst templates

Everything starts with `/docs/source/index.rst` - this file should be properly edited, Right now it just includes `readme.rst` that in turn include and parse main `README.md`. This is entrypoint to API documentation. All templates generated by AutoAPI are in `/docs/source/autoapi`. They should be eventually commited to repository and edited too.

## Steps for enhancing API documentation

1) Run `/docs/make.bat html`
2) Read the red errors/warnings - fix it in the code
3) Run `/docs/make.bat html` again until  there are not red lines
4) Edit rst files and add some meaningfull content there

> **Note**
> This can (should) be merged as is without doc-string fixes in the code or changes in templates. All additional improvements on API documentation should be made in new PRs.

> **Warning**
> You need to add new dependencies to use it. Run `create_venv`.

### **üöÄ Enhancements**


<details>
<summary>General: Connect to AYON server (base) <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/3924">#3924</a></summary>

<strong>Initial implementation of being able use AYON server in current OpenPype client. Added ability to connect to AYON server and use base queries.

</strong>AYON mode has it's own executable (and start script). To start in AYON mode just replace `start.py` with `ayon_start.py` (added tray start script to tools). Added constant `AYON_SERVER_ENABLED` to `openpype/__init__.py` to know if ayon mode is enabled. In that case Mongo is not used at all and any attempts will cause crashes.I had to modify `~/openpype/client` content to be able do this switch. Mongo implementation was moved to `mongo` subfolder and use "star imports" in files from where current imports are used. Logic of any tool or query in code was not changed at all. Since functions were based on mongo queries they don't use full potential of AYON server abilities.ATM implementation has login UI, distribution of files from server and replacement of mongo queries. For queries is used `ayon_api` module. Which is in live development so the versions may change from day to day.

<summary>Keep `publisher.create_widget` variant when creating subsets <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/5119">#5119</a></summary>

Whenever a person is creating a subset to publish, the "creator" widget resets (where you choose the variant, product, etc.) so if the person is publishing several images of the a variant which is not the default one, they have to keep selecting the correct one after every "create".

This commit resets the original variant upon successful creation of a subset for publishing.

Demo:
[Screencast from 2023-06-08 10-46-40.webm](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/assets/1800151/ca1c91d4-b8f3-43d2-a7b7-35987f5b6a3f)

## Testing notes:
1. Launch AYON/OP
2. Launch the publisher (select a project, shot, etc.)
3. Crete a publish type (any works)
4. Choose a variant for the publish that is not the default
5. "Create >>"

The Variant fields should still have the variant you choose.

<details>
<summary>Load Rig References - Change Rig to Animation in Animation instance <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4877">#4877</a></summary>

We are using the template builder to build an animation scene. All the rig placeholders are imported correctly, but the automatically created animation instances retain the rig family in their names and subsets. In our example, we need animationMain instead of rigMain, because this name will be used in the following steps like lighting.Here is the result we need. I checked, and it's not a template builder problem, because even if I load a rig as a reference, the result is the same. For me, since we are in the animation instance, it makes more sense to have animation instead of rig in the name. The naming is just fine if we use create from the Openpype menu.

<summary>Fix: Locally copied version of last published workfile is not incremented <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4722">#4722</a></summary>

### Fix 1
When copied, the local workfile version keeps the published version number, when it must be +1 to follow OP's naming convention.

### Fix 2
Local workfile version's name is built from anatomy. This avoids to get workfiles with their publish template naming.

### Fix 3
In the case a subset has at least two tasks with published workfiles, for example `Modeling` and `Rigging`, launching `Rigging` was getting the first one with the `next` and trying to find representations, therefore `workfileModeling` and trying to match the current `task_name` (`Rigging`) with the `representation["context"]["task"]["name"]` of a Modeling representation, which was ending up to a `workfile_representation` to `None`, and exiting the process.

Trying to find the `task_name` in the `subset['name']` fixes it.

### Fix 4
Fetch input dependencies of workfile.

<summary>Publisher: Plugin active attribute is respected <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4798">#4798</a></summary>

Publisher consider plugin's `active` attribute, so the plugin is not processed when `active` is set to `False`. But we use the attribute in `OptionalPyblishPluginMixin` for different purposes, so I've added hack bypass of the active state validation when plugin inherit from the mixin. This is temporary solution which cannot be changed until all hosts use Publisher otherwise global plugins would be broken. Also plugins which have `enabled` set to `False` are filtered out -> this happened only when automated settings were applied and the settings contained `"enabled"` key se to `False`.

<summary>Maya: Refactor Extract Look with dedicated processors for maketx <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4711">#4711</a></summary>

Refactor Maya extract look to fix some issues:
- [x] Allow Extraction with maketx with OCIO Color Management enabled in Maya.
- [x] Fix file hashing so it includes arguments to maketx, so that when arguments change it correctly generates a new hash
- [x] Fix maketx destination colorspace when OCIO is enabled
- [x] Use pre-collected colorspaces of the resources instead of trying to retrieve again in Extract Look
- [x] Fix colorspace attributes being reinterpreted by maya on export (fix remapping) - goal is to resolve #2337
- [x] Fix support for checking config path of maya default OCIO config (due to using `lib.get_color_management_preferences` which remaps that path)
- [x] Merged in #2971 to refactor MakeTX into TextureProcessor and also support generating Redshift `.rstexbin` files. - goal is to resolve #2599
- [x] Allow custom arguments to `maketx` from OpenPype Settings like mentioned here by @fabiaserra for arguments like: `--monochrome-detect`, `--opaque-detect`, `--checknan`.
- [x] Actually fix the code and make it work. :) (I'll try to keep below checkboxes in sync with my code changes)
- [x] Publishing without texture processor should work (no maketx + no rstexbin)
- [x] Publishing with maketx should work
- [x] Publishing with  rstexbin should work
- [x] Test it. (This is just me doing some test-runs, please still test the PR!)

<summary>Global: persistent staging directory for renders <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4583">#4583</a></summary>

<strong>Allows configure if staging directory (`stagingDir`) should be persistent with use of profiles.

</strong>With this feature, users can specify a transient data folder path based on presets, which can be used during the creation and publishing stages. In some cases, these DCCs automatically add a rendering path during the creation stage, which is then used in publishing.One of the key advantages of this feature is that it allows users to take advantage of faster storages for rendering, which can help improve workflow efficiency. Additionally, this feature allows users to keep their rendered data persistent, and use their own infrastructure for regular cleaning.However, it should be noted that some productions may want to use this feature without persistency. Furthermore, there may be a need for retargeting the rendering folder to faster storages, which is also not supported at the moment.It is studio responsibility to clean up obsolete folders with data.Location of the folder is configured in `project_anatomy/templates/others`. ('transient' key is expected, with 'folder' key, could be more templates)Which family/task type/subset is applicable is configured in:`project_settings/global/tools/publish/transient_dir_profiles`

<summary>Copy existing or generate new Fusion profile on prelaunch <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4572">#4572</a></summary>

<strong>Fusion preferences will be copied to the predefined `~/.openpype/hosts/fusion/prefs` folder (or any other folder set in system settings) on launch.

</strong>The idea is to create a copy of existing Fusion profile, adding an OpenPype menu to the Fusion instance.By default the copy setting is turned off, so no file copying is performed. Instead the clean Fusion profile is created by Fusion in the predefined folder. The default locaion is set to `~/.openpype/hosts/fusion/prefs`, to better comply with the other os platforms. After creating the default profile, some modifications are applied:
- forced Python3
- forced English interface
- setup Openpype specific path maps.If the `copy_prefs` checkbox is toggled, a copy of existing Fusion profile folder will be placed in the mentioned location. Then they are altered the same way as described above. The operation is run only once, on the first launch, unless the `force_sync [Resync profile on each launch]` is toggled.English interface is forced because the `FUSION16_PROFILE_DIR` environment variable is not read otherwise (seems to be a Fusion bug).

<summary>Houdini: Create button open new publisher's "create" tab <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4601">#4601</a></summary>

During a talk with @maxpareschi he mentioned that the new publisher in Houdini felt super confusing due to "Create" going to the older creator but now being completely empty and the publish button directly went to the publish tab.This resolves that by fixing the Create button to now open the new publisher but on the Create tab.Also made publish button enforce going to the "publish" tab for consistency in usage.@antirotor I think changing the Create button's callback was just missed in this commit or was there a specific reason to not change that around yet?

<summary>Publisher: Explicit save <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4676">#4676</a></summary>

Publisher have explicit button to save changes, so reset can happen without saving any changes. Save still happens automatically when publishing is started or on publisher window close. But a popup is shown if context of host has changed. Important context was enhanced by workfile path (if host integration supports it) so workfile changes are captured too. In that case a dialog with confirmation is shown to user. All callbacks that may require save of context were moved to main window to be able handle dialog show at one place. Save changes now returns success so the rest of logic is skipped -> publishing won't start, when save of instances fails.Save and reset buttons have shortcuts (Ctrl + s and Ctrls + r).

<summary>Maya: Fix extract look colorspace detection <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4618">#4618</a></summary>

Fix the logic which guesses the colorspace using `arnold` python library.
- Previously it'd error if `mtoa` was not available on path so it still required `mtoa` to be available.
- The guessing colorspace logic doesn't actually require `mtoa` to be loaded, but just the `arnold` python library to be available. This changes the logic so it doesn't require the `mtoa` plugin to get loaded to guess the colorspace.
- The if/else branch was likely not doing what was intended `cmds.loadPlugin("mtoa", quiet=True)` returns None if the plug-in was already loaded. So this would only ever be true if it ends up loading the `mtoa` plugin the first time.
```python
# Tested in Maya 2022.1
print(cmds.loadPlugin("mtoa", quiet=True))
# ['mtoa']
print(cmds.loadPlugin("mtoa", quiet=True))
# None
```

<summary>Scene inventory: Fix code errors when "not found" entries are found <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4594">#4594</a></summary>

Whenever a "NOT FOUND" entry is present a lot of errors happened in the Scene Inventory:
- It started spamming a lot of errors for the VersionDelegate since it had no numeric version (no version at all).Error reported on Discord:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\videopro\Documents\github\OpenPype\openpype\tools\utils\delegates.py", line 65, in paint
    text = self.displayText(
  File "C:\Users\videopro\Documents\github\OpenPype\openpype\tools\utils\delegates.py", line 33, in displayText
    assert isinstance(value, numbers.Integral), (
AssertionError: Version is not integer. "None" <class 'NoneType'>
```
- Right click menu would error on NOT FOUND entries, and thus not show. With this PR it will now _disregard_ not found items for "Set version" and "Remove" but still allow actions.This PR resolves those.

<summary>Maya: Implement image file node loader <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4313">#4313</a></summary>

<strong>Implements a loader for loading texture image into a `file` node in Maya.

</strong>Similar to Maya's hypershade creation of textures on load you have the option to choose for three modes of creating:
- Texture
- Projection
- StencilThese should match what Maya generates if you create those in Maya.
- [x] Load and manage file nodes
- [x] Apply color spaces after #4195
- [x] Support for _either_ UDIM or image sequence - currently it seems to always load sequences as UDIM automatically.
- [ ] Add support for animation sequences of UDIM textures using the `<f>.<udim>.exr` path format?

<summary>Maya Look Assigner: Don't rely on containers for get all assets <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4600">#4600</a></summary>

This resolves #4044 by not actually relying on containers in the scene but instead just rely on finding nodes with `cbId` attributes. As such, imported nodes would also be found and a shader can be assigned (similar to when using get from selection).**Please take into consideration the potential downsides below**Potential downsides would be:
- IF an already loaded look has any dagNodes, say a 3D Projection node - then that will also show up as a loaded asset where previously nodes from loaded looks were ignored.
- If any dag nodes were created locally - they would have gotten `cbId` attributes on scene save and thus the current asset would almost always show?

<summary>Refactored Generation of UE Projects, installation of plugins moved to the engine <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4369">#4369</a></summary>

<strong>Improved the way how OpenPype works with generation of UE projects. Also the installation of the plugin has been altered to install into the engine

</strong>OpenPype now uses the appropriate tools to generate UE projects. Unreal Build Tool (UBT) and a "Commandlet Project" is needed to properly generate a BP project, or C++ code in case that `dev_mode = True`, folders, the .uproject file and many other resources.On the plugin's side, it is built seperately with the UnrealAutomationTool (UAT) and then it's contents are moved under the `Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/OpenPype` directory.

<summary>TVPaint: Use Publisher tool <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4471">#4471</a></summary>

<strong>Use Publisher tool and new creation system in TVPaint integration.

</strong>Using new creation system makes TVPaint integration a little bit easier to maintain for artists. Removed unneeded tools Creator and Subset Manager tools. Goal is to keep the integration work as close as possible to previous integration. Some changes were made but primarilly because they were not right using previous system.All creators create instance with final family instead of changing the family during extraction. Render passes are not related to group id but to render layer instance. Render layer is still related to group. Workfile, review and scene render instances are created using autocreators instead of auto-collection during publishing. Subset names are fully filled during publishing but instance labels are filled on refresh with the last known right value. Implemented basic of legacy convertor which should convert render layers and render passes.

</strong>Added new creator that must be triggered by artist. The create plugin will first create Render Layer instances if were not created yet. For variant is used color group name. The creator has option to rename color groups by template defined in settings -> Template may use index of group by it's usage in scene (from bottom to top). After Render Layers will create Render Passes. Render Pass is created for each individual TVPaint layer in any group that had created Render Layer. It's name is used as variant (pass).

Disable review of Render Layer and Render Pass instances by default. In most of productions is used only "scene review".

## Enhancement



This PR is adding update/switch ability to pointcache/alembic loader in 3dsmax and fixing wrong tool shown when clicking on "Manage" item on OpenPype menu, that is now correctly Scene Inventory (but was Subset Manager).



Alembic update has still one caveat - it doesn't cope with changed number of object inside alembic, since loading alembic in max involves creating all those objects as first class nodes. So it will keep the objects in scene, just update path to alembic file on them.

This change define how to receive current context information -> call functions instead of accessing `legacy_io.Session` or `os.environ` directly. Plus, direct access on session or environments is unfortunatelly not enough for some DCCs where multiple workfiles can be opened at one time which can heavily affect the context but host integration sometimes can't affect that at all.`HostBase` already had implemented `get_current_context`, that was enhanced by adding more specific methods `get_current_project_name`, `get_current_asset_name` and `get_current_task_name`. The same functions were added to `~/openpype/pipeline/cotext_tools.py`. The functions in context tools are calling host integration methods (if are available) otherwise are using environent variables as default implementation does. Also was added `get_current_host_name` to receive host name from registered host if is available or from environment variable.

___

#### Brief description

Using the new publisher UI would generate a visible 'null' locator at the origin. It's confusing to the user since it's supposed to be 'hidden'.



#### Description

Before this PR the user would see a locator/null at the origin which was the 'hidden' `/obj/OpenPypeContext` node. This null would suddenly appear if the user would've ever opened the Publisher UI once.After this PR it will not show:Nice and tidy.

___

#### Brief description

Once upon a time in a land far far away there lived a few plug-ins who felt like they didn't belong in generic boxes and felt they needed to be versioned well above others. They tried, but with no success.



#### Description

Even though they now lived in a universe with elaborate `version` and `category` attributes embedded into their tiny little plug-in DNA this particular deviation has been greatly unused. There is nothing special about the version, nothing special about the category.It does nothing.

___

#### Brief description

Treat `{originalBasename}` in different way then standard files processing. In case template should use `{originalBasename}` the transfers will use them as they are without any changes or handling of frames.



#### Description

Frames handling is problematic with original basename because their padding can't be defined to match padding in source filenames. Also it limits the usage of functionality to "must have frame at end of fiename". This is proposal how that could be solved by simply ignoring frame handling and using filenames as are on representation. First frame is still stored to representation context but is not used in formatting part. This way we don't have to care about padding of frames at all.

___

#### Brief description

Added crashes of creators and convertos discovery (lazy solution).



#### Description

Report in Publisher also contains information about crashed files caused during creator plugin discovery and convertor plugin discovery. They're not separated into categroies and there is no other information in the report about them, but this helps a lot during development. This change does not need to change format/schema of the report nor UI logic.

Looking at the commit history of the plug-in itself it seems this might have been broken somewhere between two to three years. I think it's broken since two years since this commit.Should this plug-in be removed completely?@tokejepsen Is there still a use case where we should have this plug-in?

___

#### Brief description

When FPS is registered in for example Ftrack and round either down or up (floor/ceil), comparing to Maya FPS can fail. Example:23.97 (Ftrack/Mongo) != 23.976023976023978 (Maya)



#### Description

Since Maya only has a select number of supported framerates, I've taken the approach of converting any fps to supported framerates in Maya. We validate the input fps to make sure they are supported in Maya in two ways:Whole Numbers - are validated straight against the supported framerates in Maya.Demical Numbers - we find the closest supported framerate in Maya. If the difference to the closest supported framerate, is more than 0.5 we'll throw an error.If Maya ever supports arbitrary framerates, then we might have a problem but I'm not holding my breath...

#### Brief description

Changes of instances and context have complex, hard to get structure. The structure did not change but instead of complex dictionaries are used objected data.



#### Description

This is poposal of changes data improvement for creators. Implemented `TrackChangesItem` which handles the changes for us. The item is creating changes based on old and new value and can provide information about changed keys or access to full old or new value. Can give the values on any "sub-dictionary".Used this new approach to fix change in houdini and 3ds max and also modified one aftereffects plugin using changes.

<summary>General: Attribute definitions fixes (<i><font color='#367F6C';>other</font> </i> ) - <a href="https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/pull/4392">#4392</a></summary>

___

#### Brief description

Fix possible issues with attribute definitions in publisher if there is unknown attribute on an instance.



#### Description

Source of the issue is that attribute definitions from creator plugin could be "expanded" during `CreatedInstance` initialization. Which would affect all other instances using the same list of attributes -> literally object of list. If the same list object is used in "BaseClass" for other creators it would affect all instances (because of 1 instance). There had to be implemented other changes to fix the issue and keep behavior the same.Object of `CreatedInstance` can be created without reference to creator object. `CreatedInstance` is responsible to give UI attribute definitions (technically is prepared for cases when each instance may have different attribute definitions -> not yet).Attribute definition has added more conditions for `__eq__` method and have implemented `__ne__` method (which is required for Py 2 compatibility). Renamed `AbtractAttrDef` to `AbstractAttrDef` (fix typo).

I wanted to remove the file slowly function by function but it always reappear somewhere in codebase even if most of the functionality imported from there is triggering deprecation warnings. This is small change which may have huge impact.There shouldn't be anything in openpype codebase which is using `openpype.api` anymore so only possible issues are in customized repositories or custom addons.

When we build a template with Maya Template Builder, it will update the asset field of the sets (creator instances) that are imported from the template.



#### Description

When building a template, we also want to define the publishable content in advance: create an instance of a model, or look, etc., to speed up the workflow and reduce the number of questions we are asked. After building a work file from a saved template that contains pre-created instances, the template builder should update the asset field to the current asset.

___

#### Brief description

Introduced new field to insert frame(s) to rerender only.



#### Description

Rendering is expensive, sometimes it is helpful only to re-render changed frames and reuse existing.Artists can in Publisher fill which frame(s) should be re-rendered.If there is already published version of currently publishing subset, all representation files are collected (currently for `render` family only) and then when Nuke is rendering (locally only for now), old published files are copied into into temporary render folder where will be rewritten only by frames explicitly set in new field.That way review/burnin process could also reuse old files and recreate reviews/burnins.New version is produced during this process!

#### Brief description

General overhaul of the Arnold Scene Source (ASS) workflow.



#### Description

This originally was to support static files (non-sequencial) ASS publishing, but digging deeper whole workflow needed an update to get ready for further issues. During this overhaul the following changes were made:

- Generalized Arnold Standin workflow to a single loader.

- Support multiple nodes as proxies.

- Support proxies for `pointcache` family.

- Generalized approach to proxies as resources, so they can be the same file format as the original.This workflow should allow further expansion to utilize operators and eventually USD.

### Misc
- System and diagnostic info tool in the tray.
- Launching application from Launcher indicates activity.
- All project roots are now named. Single root project are now achieved by having a single named root in the project anatomy.
- Every project root is cast into environment variable as well, so it can be used in DCC instead of absolute path (depends on DCC support for env vars).
- Basic support for task types, on top of task names.
- Timer now change automatically when the context is switched inside running application.
- 'Master" versions have been renamed to "Hero".

- Archive Assets.
- Move Asset within hierarchy.

### Site Sync (beta)
- Synchronization of published files between workstations and central storage.
- Ability to add arbitrary storage providers to the Site Sync system.
- Default setup includes Disk and Google Drive providers as examples.
- Access to availability information from Loader and Scene Manager.
- Sync queue GUI with filtering, error and status reporting.
- Site sync can be configured on a per-project basis.
- Bulk upload and download from the loader.

### Ftrack
- Actions have customisable roles.
- Settings on all actions are updated live and don't need openpype restart.
- Ftrack module can now be turned off completely.
- It is enough to specify ftrack server name and the URL will be formed correctly. So instead of mystudio.ftrackapp.com, it's possible to use simply: "mystudio".

### Editorial
- Fully OTIO based editorial publishing.
- Completely re-done Hiero publishing to be a lot simpler and faster.
- Consistent conforming from Resolve, Hiero and Standalone Publisher.
