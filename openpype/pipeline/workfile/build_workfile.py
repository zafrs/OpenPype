"""Workfile build based on settings.

Workfile builder will do stuff based on project settings. Advantage is that
it need only access to settings. Disadvantage is that it is hard to focus
build per context and being explicit about loaded content.

For more explicit workfile build is recommended 'AbstractTemplateBuilder'
from '~/openpype/pipeline/workfile/workfile_template_builder'. Which gives
more abilities to define how build happens but require more code to achive it.
