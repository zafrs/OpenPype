    Host is pipeline implementation of DCC application. This class should help

    Compared to 'avalon' concept:
    What was before considered as functions in host implementation folder. The
    host implementation should primarily care about adding ability of creation
    (mark subsets to be published) and optionaly about referencing published
    representations as containers.

    Host may need extend some functionality like working with workfiles
    or loading. Not all host implementations may allow that for those purposes
    can be logic extended with implementing functions for the purpose. There
    are prepared interfaces to be able identify what must be implemented to
    be able use that functionality.
    - current statement is that it is not required to inherit from interfaces
        but all of the methods are validated (only their existence!)
