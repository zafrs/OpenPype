## Publishing to a different asset context

There are publish instances present which are publishing into a different asset than your current context.

Usually this is not what you want but there can be cases where you might want to publish into another asset/shot or task.

If that's the case you can disable the validation on the instance to ignore it.

The wrong node's name is: \`{node_name}\`

### Correct context keys and values:

\`{correct_values}\`

### Wrong keys and values:

\`{wrong_values}\`.


## How to repair?

1. Use \"Repair\" button.
2. Hit Reload button on the publisher.
