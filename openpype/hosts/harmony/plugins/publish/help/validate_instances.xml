## Invalid subset context

Asset name found '{found}' in subsets, expected '{expected}'.

### How to repair?

You can fix this with `Repair` button on the right. This will use '{expected}' asset name and overwrite '{found}' asset name in scene metadata.

After that restart `Publish` with a `Reload button`.

If this is unwanted, close workfile and open again, that way different asset value would be used for context information.

### __Detailed Info__ (optional)

This might happen if you are reuse old workfile and open it in different context.
(Eg. you created subset "renderCompositingDefault" from asset "Robot' in "your_project_Robot_compositing.aep", now you opened this workfile in a context "Sloth" but existing subset for "Robot" asset stayed in the workfile.)
