## No secondary workfile found

Current process expects that primary workfile (for example with a extension '{extension}') will contain also 'secondary' workfile.

Secondary workfile for '{file_name}' wasn't found.

### How to repair?

Attach secondary workfile or disable this validator and Publish again.

### __Detailed Info__ (optional)

This process was implemented for a possible use case of first workfile coming from Mari, secondary workfile for textures from Substance.
Publish should contain both if primary workfile is present.
