<title>Missing source video file</title>

## No attached video file found

Process expects presence of source video file with same name prefix as an editorial file in same folder.
(example `simple_editorial_setup_Layer1.edl` expects `simple_editorial_setup.mp4` in same folder)


### How to repair?

Copy source video file to the folder next to `.edl` file. (On a disk, do not put it into Standalone Publisher.)
