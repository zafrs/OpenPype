    Maya can have invalid geometry with vertices that have no edges or

        `maya.cmds.polyClean(mesh, cleanVertices=True)`

    and merge the components.

    To find these invalid vertices select all vertices of the mesh
    that are visible in the viewport (drag to select), afterwards
    invert your selection (Ctrl + Shift + I). The remaining selection
