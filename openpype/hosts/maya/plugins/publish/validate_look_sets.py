    """Validate if any sets relationships are not being collected.

    A shader can be assigned to a node that is missing a Colorbleed ID.
    Because it is missing the ID it has not been collected in the instance.
    This validator ensures those relationships and thus considers it invalid
    if a relationship was not collected.

    When the relationship needs to be maintained the artist might need to
    create a different* relationship or ensure the node has the Colorbleed ID.

    *The relationship might be too broad (assigned to top node of hierarchy).
    This can be countered by creating the relationship on the shape or its
    transform. In essence, ensure item the shader is assigned to has the
    Colorbleed ID!

    Examples:

    - Displacement objectSets (like V-Ray):

        It is best practice to add the transform of the shape to the
        displacement objectSet. Any parent groups will not work as groups
        do not receive a Colorbleed Id. As such the assignments need to be
        made to the shapes and their transform.

        Example content:
            [asset_GRP|geometry_GRP|body_GES,
             asset_GRP|geometry_GRP|L_eye_GES,
             asset_GRP|geometry_GRP|R_eye_GES,
             asset_GRP|geometry_GRP|wings_GEO]
