    """Validates that Shape names are using Maya's default format.

    When you create a new polygon cube Maya will name the transform
    and shape respectively:
    - ['pCube1', 'pCubeShape1']
    If you rename it to `bar1` it will become:
    - ['bar1', 'barShape1']
    Then if you rename it to `bar` it will become:
    - ['bar', 'barShape']
    Rename it again to `bar1` it will differ as opposed to before:
    - ['bar1', 'bar1Shape']
    Note that bar1Shape != barShape1
    Thus the suffix number can be either in front of Shape or behind it.
    Then it becomes harder to define where what number should be when a
    node contains multiple shapes, for example with many controls in
    rigs existing of multiple curves.
