            ## Non unique subset name found

            Non unique subset names: '{non_unique}'
            <detail>
                ### __Detailed Info__ (optional)

                This might happen if you already published for this asset
                review subset with legacy name {task}Review.
                This legacy name limits possibility of publishing of multiple
                reviews from a single workfile. Proper review subset name should
                now
                contain variant also (as 'Main', 'Default' etc.). That would
                result in completely new subset though, so this situation must
                be handled manually.
            </detail>
            ### How to repair?

            Legacy subsets must be removed from Openpype DB, please ask admin
            to do that. Please provide them asset and subset names.
