<description>## Your scene is from different project

It is not possible to publish into project "{workfile_project_name}" when TVPaint was opened with project "{env_project_name}" in context.

### How to repair?

If the workfile belongs to project "{env_project_name}" then use Workfiles tool to resave it.

Otherwise close TVPaint and launch it again from project you want to publish in.

### How this could happen?

You've opened workfile from different project. You've opened TVPaint on a task from "{env_project_name}" then you've opened TVPaint again on task from "{workfile_project_name}" without closing the TVPaint. Because TVPaint can run only once the project didn't change.

### Why it is important?
Because project may affect how TVPaint works or change publishing behavior it is dangerous to allow change project context in many ways. For example publishing will not run as expected.
