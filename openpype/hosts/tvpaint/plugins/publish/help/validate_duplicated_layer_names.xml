<description>## Duplicated layer names

Can't determine which layers should be published because there are duplicated layer names in the scene.

### Duplicated layer names

{layer_names}

*Check layer names for all subsets in list on left side.*

### How to repair?

Hide/rename/remove layers that should not be published.

If all of them should be published then you have duplicated subset names in the scene. In that case you have to recrete them and use different variant name.
