<title>Subset context</title>
<description>## Invalid subset context

Context of the given subset doesn't match your current scene.

### How to repair?

Yout can fix this with "Repair" button on the right. This will use '{expected_asset}' asset name and overwrite '{found_asset}' asset name in scene metadata.

After that restart publishing with Reload button.

### How could this happen?

The subset was created in different scene with different context
or the scene file was copy pasted from different context.
