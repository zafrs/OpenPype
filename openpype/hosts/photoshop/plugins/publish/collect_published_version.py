"""Collects published version of workfile and increments it.

For synchronization of published image and workfile version it is required
to store workfile version from workfile file name in context.data["version"].
In remote publishing this name is unreliable (artist might not follow naming
convention etc.), last published workfile version for particular workfile
subset is used instead.

This plugin runs only in remote publishing (eg. Webpublisher).

Requires:
    context.data["assetEntity"]

Provides:
    context["version"] - incremented latest published workfile version
