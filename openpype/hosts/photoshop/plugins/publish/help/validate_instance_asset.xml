## Collected asset name is not same as in context

    {msg}
### How to repair?
    {repair_msg}
    Refresh Publish afterwards (circle arrow at the bottom right).

    If that's not correct value, close workfile and reopen via Workfiles to get
    proper context asset name OR disable this validator and publish again
    if you are publishing to different context deliberately.

    (Context means combination of project, asset name and task name.)
