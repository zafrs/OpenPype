    This checks whether the Fusion process is still active at a certain

    runs in its own environment and process (a `fusionscript` process each).
    If Fusion would go down and we have a UI process running at the same time
    then it can happen that the `fusionscript.exe` will remain running in the
    background in limbo due to e.g. a Qt interface's QApplication that keeps
    running infinitely.

        When the host is not detected this will automatically exit
        the current process.
