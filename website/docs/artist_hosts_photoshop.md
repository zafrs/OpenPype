In Photoshop you can find the tools in the `OpenPype` extension:

You can show the extension panel by going to `Window` > `Extensions` > `OpenPype`.

### Create

When you have created an image you want to publish, you will need to create special groups or tag existing groups. To do this open the `Creator` through the extensions `Create` button.

With the `Creator` you have a variety of options to create:

- Check `Use selection` (A dialog will ask whether you want to create one image per selected layer).
    - Yes.
        - No selection.
            - This will create a single group named after the `Subset` in the `Creator`.
        - Single selected layer.
            - The selected layer will be grouped under a single group named after the selected layer.
        - Single selected group.
            - The selected group will be tagged for publishing.
        - Multiple selected items.
            - Each selected group will be tagged for publishing and each layer will be grouped individually.
    - No.
        - All selected layers will be grouped under a single group named after the `Subset` in the `Creator`.
- Uncheck `Use selection`.
    - This will create a single group named after the `Subset` in the `Creator`.

### Publish

When you are ready to share some work, you will need to publish. This is done by opening the `Pyblish` through the extensions `Publish` button.

This tool will run through checks to make sure the contents you are publishing is correct. Hit the "Play" button to start publishing.

You may encounter issues with publishing which will be indicated with red squares. If these issues are within the validation section, then you can fix the issue. If there are issues outside of validation section, please let the OpenPype team know.

#### Repair Validation Issues

All validators will give some description about what the issue is. You can inspect this by going into the validator through the arrow:
